## GitHub Copilot Usage

**Tool:** GitHub Copilot (AI-powered code completion and assistance)

**Purpose:** Documentation and formatting of ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md

**Scope of Use:**
- Organizing and structuring the ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md file
- Formatting analysis results and tables for clarity
- Technical documentation of methodology in the README

**Key Responsibilities:**
- All written answers to assignment questions (Q1b, Q2a, Q2b, Q2c) are my own work
- All data analysis, calculations, and code implementation were performed by me independently
- All MAPE calculations, exponential smoothing implementation, and train-test splitting were completed without AI assistance
- Copilot assistance was limited to organizing the technical documentation in ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md

**Prompt Snippets (Representative Examples):**
- "Help me organize and format the README documentation for clarity"
- "Format this data table for better readability"
- "Put this analysis output into the readme file"

## Conclusion

GitHub Copilot was used as a collaborative tool to help organize and structure ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md. All substantive analysis, implementation, and written answers remain my own work and responsibility.
